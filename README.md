PHP Learning Fun Times Yay
by Will Hawkins and Taylor Scott

Why did you choose this subject?
```
PHP is a very popular language for a lot of oft-used technologies in web development (Wordpress, Drupel... Facebook uses it!)
```
How were you first made aware of it?
```
It's one of the most well-known programming languages!
```
What problem does it solve? How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Why does one use it?
```
It's mostly used for powerful server-side scripting with a wide variety of both outpou formats and database formats. It can basically talk to any service as well!
```
What are the alternatives?
```
Any language, as long as there's server software supporting it - Javascript for Node.js, for example.
```
What is it similar to, if anything?
```
Conceptually and syntactically it's quite similar to Javascript. Many of the terms are the same or very similar.
```
What is the history of this technology? Who built it and why? Who is maintaining it?
```
PHP was built by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, as a combination of JavaScript and C, for use in monitoring his online resume and related personal information. It's maintained by the PHP Group (http://php.net/credits.php).
```
What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
```
It seems broadly useful, overall. From our reading, we gathered that it's very handy for a developer to be at least familiar with PHP. No real conceptual hurdles thanks to already being familiar with JS (and Ruby to a lesser extent).
```
What resources do you recommend for interested students?
```
CodeAcademy, php.net
```
What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
```
We used CodeAcademy, and although the website itself was having serious issues, it got the knowledge across in a clean, easy-to-read manner.
```
What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
```
--What are the main error types in PHP and how do they differ?
--How we can get the number of elements in an array?
--What are the __construct() and __destruct() methods in a PHP class?
```
Also, please include the instructions necessary to...

Run your example.
```

```
Do I need to run bower install? Do I need an API key?
Use your subject.
Do I need to include it in my HTML with <script> tags? Do I need to brew install anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?
