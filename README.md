PHP Learning Fun Times Yay
by Will Hawkins and Taylor Scott

Why did you choose this subject?
```
PHP is a very popular language for a lot of oft-used technologies in web development (Wordpress, Drupel... Facebook uses it too!)
```
How were you first made aware of it?
```
It's one of the most well-known programming languages!
```
What problem does it solve? How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Why does one use it?
```
It's mostly used for powerful server-side scripting with a wide variety of both output formats and database formats. It can basically talk to any service as well!
```
What are the alternatives?
```
Any language, as long as there's server software supporting it - Javascript for Node.js, for example.
```
What is it similar to, if anything?
```
Conceptually and syntactically it's quite similar to Javascript. Many of the terms are the same or very similar.
```
What is the history of this technology? Who built it and why? Who is maintaining it?
```
PHP was built by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, as a combination of JavaScript and C, for use in monitoring his online resume and related personal information. It's maintained by the PHP Group (http://php.net/credits.php).
```
What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
```
It seems broadly useful, overall. From our reading, we gathered that it's very handy for a developer to be at least familiar with PHP. No real conceptual hurdles thanks to already being familiar with JS (and Ruby to a lesser extent).
```
What resources do you recommend for interested students?
```
CodeAcademy, php.net
```
What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
```
We used CodeAcademy, and although the website itself was having serious issues, it got the knowledge across in a clean, easy-to-read manner.
```
What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
```
What are the main error types in PHP and how do they differ?

How we can get the number of elements in an array?

What are the __construct() and __destruct() methods in a PHP class?
```
Also, please include the instructions necessary to...

Run your example.

Here's the repl! If you have PHP installed on your computer, you could also run this inside of HTML! Simply copy and paste the repl between some PHP tags: <?php ... ?>
